# k-means-clustering-matlab

The k-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular method is an unsupervised machine learning technique used to identify clusters of data objects in a dataset. 

In this project k-means clustering is implemented in MATLAB. The datasets are created randomly and depending on the selected group number the implemetation clisters the dataset depending on their position and distances between data on xy-axis.
